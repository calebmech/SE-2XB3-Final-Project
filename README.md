BixiTrip
========
Instructions on usage and installation
--------------------------------------
1. Open ```SE-2XB3-Final-Project``` folder in Eclipse and open the project ```Group01_FinalProject```
2. To run the console version of the program, run ```BixiTrip.java``` with a valid start station code and end station code as arguments.
3. To run the UI version of the program, run ```BixiTripUI.java```. Start and end stations can be selected from within the UI, so no input arguments are necessary.

The program will automatically generate and open a Google Maps trip URL in your default browser once a trip has been found.
